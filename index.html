					I like dogs. They're pretty neat animals. They like me, I
					like them. With dogs, I am of the opinion that bigger is
					better. I also believe that, in general, fluffier is better;
					however, I understand that fluffiness should be strongly
					correlated with dog size. It is my opinion that tiny dogs
					shouldn't be super fluffy and that giant dogs shouldn't have
					super short fur. This is of course just an opinion, and not
					one I even feel that strongly about. I just needed something
					to write about to fulfill my quota.
				</p>
				<p>
					The opinion I have on dogs that I do feel strongly about is
					that cats are better. I won't go into depth about why that
					is true, because, ultimately, I do not know. I recognize and
					embrace that I am biased and prejudiced towards cats.
				</p>
				<p>
					Realizing that I still need fifty-seven words, I must
					mention that tortoises are the best animal. They look funny,
					act funny, and move slow. What more could be desired from a
					pet? They have all sorts of different personalities,
					although I only have experience with aggressive ones.
					Tortoises that will chase cats and dogs around, while
					headbutting other tortoises. And that's all my words.

					I like pizza. It's a pretty neat food item. It likes me, I
					like it. With pizza, I am of the opinion that bigger is
					better. I also believe that, in general, cheesier is better;
					however, I understand that cheesiness should be strongly
					correlated with pizza size. It is my opinion that tiny
					pizzas shouldn't be super cheesy and that giant pizzas
					shouldn't be super saucy. This is of course just an opinion,
					and not one I even feel that strongly about. I just needed
					something to write about to fulfill my quota.

					The opinion I have on pizza that I do feel strongly about is
					that nothing is better. I won't go into depth about why that
					is true, because, ultimately, I do not know. I recognize and
					embrace that I am biased and prejudiced towards pizza.

					Realizing that I still need fifty-six words, I must mention
					that burgers are the best sandwich. They taste good, look
					good, and cook fast. What more could be desired from a
					sandwich? They have all sorts of different toppings,
					although I only have experience with plain ones. Burgers
					that will lure cats and dogs towards me while I eat them. My
					words finish.
