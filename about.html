			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				My name is Elijah Porter. I am 20 years old and a Junior in the
				MSU Computer Science program. I got interested in programming
				when I first started elementary school by reading books on HTML
				and web development at the library.
			</p>
			<p>Here are a few things that I like:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Concrete</li>
				<li>Basements</li>
				<li>Water</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				It's cool because all of those are related. You use water to mix
				concrete, you use concrete to make basements, and you don't want
				water collecting in your basement. I used to work as a laborer
				for a concrete contractor, if you couldn't tell.
